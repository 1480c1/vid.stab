These are filters for the libavfilter framework.

Hopefully they get integrated into ffmpeg but until then you have
 to do the following to get it working:

- install the vidstab lib from src/cmake with e.g.
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local ../
make
make install

link/copy the vf_vidstabdetect.c and vf_vidstabtransform.c files to your
ffmpeg/libavfilter/

add the following lines to the files in libavfilter/
allfilters.c

    REGISTER_FILTER (STABILIZE,   vidstabdetect,   vf);
    REGISTER_FILTER (TRANSFORM,   vidstabtransform,   vf);

Makefile

and
OBJS-$(CONFIG_STABILIZE_FILTER)              += vf_vidstabdetect.o
OBJS-$(CONFIG_TRANSFORM_FILTER)              += vf_vidstabtransform.o

and
configure ffmpeg with

--extra-libs="-lvidstab"
